# Update:
This project was created on github.ccs.neu.edu with a team. The account is no longer accessible due to:
```
This is an automated process triggered by the NUID you provided falling out of our registrar data feed. The most likely causes of this are that you have graduated or are no longer taking a class at Khoury. Per university and college policy, services must end within 30 days of such an affiliation change.
```

However I was able to download this previous project before losing access.
