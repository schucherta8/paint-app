# Final Deliverable

The final push! You are almost there!

For your final project, here is a list of items you need to incoporate--many you might have already done, so check them off as completed.

- Build Tasks
  - [ ] A CMakeLists.txt which generates a makefile to create a:
    - [ ] Release version of your software
  - [ ] Run your code with the latest version of cppcheck
  - [ ] Run your code with the latest version of clang-tiny
- Project Management Tasks  
  - [ ] Run doxygen and push your documentation to your repository in a folder called 'docs'
  - [ ] Create a youtube video of your final project working
          - This video should be no greater than 5 minutes in length. Consider it a portfolio piece showing off how your software works and what techologies you used. 
  - [ ] Instructions on how to build your software should be written here: [build.md](./build.md)
          - This is especially important if you have added additional dependencies.
          - Assume someone who has not taken this class (i.e. you on the first day) would have read, build, and run your software from scratch.
- Testing Tasks
  - [ ] Make sure there are at least 8 tests written.
  - [ ] Make sure you have a Github action that runs all of these tests on 'push'
- Remaining Programming Tasks
  - [ ] Any remaining feature updates!

## Additional notes

- Make sure I can view your video! (i.e. do not make it private)
  - Hint: You can test to see if I would be able to view it by viewing your video in a private browser or incognito mode.
- You cannot publicly share this repository of code, but you may share your youtube video on your resume/portfolio as you like!
